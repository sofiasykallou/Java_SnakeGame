# Java Snake Game

This is a practice project that features the classic Snake game implemented in Java. The game utilizes the AWT and Swing graphics libraries to create a graphical user interface (GUI) that displays the gameplay.

## Inspiration

The development of this project is inspired by a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y62MJny9LHg) and the implementation provided in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ImKennyYip/snake-java).

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** The game uses Java's AWT and Swing libraries to render the game's visuals and manage the user interface, providing a responsive and intuitive gameplay experience.
- **Game Loop:** A fundamental game loop is implemented to continuously update the game state and render the graphics, ensuring smooth and consistent gameplay.
- **Keyboard Input Handling:** Listeners for key presses are integrated to control the movement of the snake, making the game interactive and engaging.
- **Snake Segments Management:** The game employs an `ArrayList` to dynamically manage the segments of the snake, facilitating the growth of the snake as it consumes food items.
- **Collision and Boundary Checks:** Logic is incorporated to detect collisions with the snake's own body or the boundaries of the game area, which leads to game over, adding challenge to the game.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, ensure that you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed to compile and run the project.
